# walls

These are the only parts of [dkeg]'s wonderful [crayolo] project that I use - the source wallpapers for the Xresources derived by their script. Yes, they extract into beautiful schemes - especially for thse of us who like to stay in 16-color schemes rather than Trve Color visual distractions - but they also form *very* luscious complimentary and tertiary color palettes.

Seriously. That shit be ###**SEXY**### in ways not conveyable with md. Or even the most arcane LaTeX possible. "Taste The Rainbow" doesn't even come close. "Splosh orgy with a cast of thousands and The Rainbow," maybe... YMMV

I'm still working out efficient shell to automate scripting the variations (and other derivative Xres scheme structures), as my dinosaur mind wrote them in really, really kludgy Perl. Eventually, they'll show up... but don't hold your breath too long (unless that's a kink of yours. in that case, um, er... RACK, okay?)
